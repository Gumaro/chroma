Release compatibility
=================================
Chroma/QDP/QMP have release tags enumerated as

    major.minor.maintenance 

with cvs tags labelled as

    major-minor-maintenance 

Chroma version 1.7 requires QDP++ 1.6 or higher and
QMP 1.3.X . The latter follows the version 1.X specification
of the API. Currently, QDP++ is not compatible with 
QMP version 2.0beta .

In JLab CVS module name and tag-ology, the current compatibility is

module        tag                          description
chroma        chroma1-6-X   or higher
qdp++         qdp1-6-X      or higher
qmp           qmp1-3-1                     MPI and GM versions
qmp-mvia-mesh qmp-mvia-mesh-0-9  or higher GigE version
qmp-single    qmp1-0-0      or higher      single-node version

QCDOC QMP - whatever is the current version (?)


Quick installations instructions for CHROMA
=================================

It is assumed that QDP++ is compiled and **installed** somewhere. You
can read the INSTALL file in this directory for more details on the
building of chroma.

To build CHROMA, it is recommended you make a subdirectory for the
build and keep the build tree separate from the source tree. E.g., say
the "scalar" version of QDP++ is installed in
/usr/local/share/qdp++/scalar

Then to build, you would execute:

% cd chroma
% mkdir ./scalar-build
% cd ./scalar-build
% ../configure --with-qdp=/usr/local/qdp++/scalar
% make

which should build the CHROMA library using a scalar version 
of QDP++. 

To build a main program

% cd chroma/scalar-build/mainprogs/tests/t_mesplq
% make t_mesplq

which will build the executable "t_mesplq" using "t_mesplq.cc" as
the main program file and linking against the library in
chroma/scalar/lib .

You can execute the program simply by

% ./t_mesplq

which will compute the average plaquette on a random gauge
field and write the result into  "t_mespl.nml" .
