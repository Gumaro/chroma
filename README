Quick installations instructions for CHROMA
=================================

It is assumed that QDP++ is compiled and **installed** somewhere. You
can read the INSTALL file in this directory for more details on the
building of chroma.

To build CHROMA, it is recommended you make a subdirectory for the
build and keep the build tree separate from the source tree. E.g., say
the "scalar" version of QDP++ is installed in
/usr/local/share/qdp++/scalar

Then to build, you would execute:

% cd chroma
% mkdir ./scalar-build
% cd ./scalar-build
% ../configure --with-qdp=/usr/local/qdp++/scalar
% make

which should build the CHROMA library using a scalar version 
of QDP++. 

To build a main program

% cd chroma/scalar-build/mainprogs/tests/t_mesplq
% make t_mesplq

which will build the executable "t_mesplq" using "t_mesplq.cc" as
the main program file and linking against the library in
chroma/scalar/lib .

You can execute the program simply by

% ./t_mesplq

which will compute the average plaquette on a random gauge
field and write the result into  "t_mespl.nml" .
