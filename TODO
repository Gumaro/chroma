      Laundry List   -  19 Feb 2005

\item Change check_PROGRAMS to bin_PROGRAMS and install binaries
in chroma/mainprogs/main

\item (*) Implement full Chrono predictor for HMC. This could win
a factor of 2 based on comparisons of CG counts for linear pred.
and RBC full chrono cg counts.

\item (*) H_T ContFrac cost-vs-mres tests

\item (*) Add force monitoring for HMC. Currently, we have energy
contributions for each monomial. More useful is contributions to force
for each monomial. This monitor is simply  norm2(ds_u)

\item (*) Bagel/QMP-2 tests for IBM Bluegene/L and NERSC SP

Based on force monitoring tests:
  \item Fractional power monomials??? 
  \item Sexton-Weingarten integration for gauge piece ala Degrand???
  \item SAP for force term???

\item Stout-link deriv. for HMC

\item Aniso precond. and even-odd aniso precond. for linops
\item Aniso precond. and even-odd aniso precond. for HMC

\item Simple aniso for DWF - fix weirdness
