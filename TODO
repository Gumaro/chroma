      Laundry List   -  23 Feb 2005

\item (*) H_T ContFrac cost-vs-mres tests

\item (*) Bagel/QMP-2 tests for IBM Bluegene/L and NERSC SP. {\em B\'alint: BAGEL QMP2 Runs on BlueGene/L. QMP-2 is a big but fixed hit. NERSC Still to be Done}

\item (*) PARTFILE I/O in QIO, for efficient I/O on QCDOC.

\item Fix eesu3 to not cause infinite loops compiling on MACS. This
really means unify the eesuN and the expsuN routines.

\item Get prec and unprec clover fermacts working. Eventually get deriv
working.

Based on force monitoring tests:
  \item Fractional power monomials??? 
  \item Sexton-Weingarten integration for gauge piece ala Degrand???
  \item SAP for force term???

\item Stout-link deriv. for HMC. How do we add stout smearing for the
actions??? Is this a new  "state" ?? We can't overload on the arg types
to the factory calls.

\item Aniso precond. and even-odd aniso precond. for linops
\item Aniso precond. and even-odd aniso precond. for HMC

\item Aniso support in GaugeActs - its nearly there, only IO.

\item Make generic update "harness" that also works for pure-gauge
heatbath.

\item Make heat-bath production ready. Need over-relaxation. Need I/O !

\item Need some kind of reader/writer (??) for ILDG meta-data conventions???
BJ points out management stuff not workable. Could do physics portion.

\item Make xcheck that uses XMLDiff for complete regression tests.

\item A. Hart says the subset-ted reunit is slow - should use
QDP's profile and isolate.

STAGGERED TODO list (Sept 2005)
-----------------------------------

\item Reduce the number of copies of the gauge configuration
      used from classes that inherit from the staggered_hadron_corr
      Probably best to use a singleton or something.

\item Test and add the vector mesons to the inline code.

\item add singlet vector operators.

\item Add the code that computes all 8 spatially
      local pseudoscalar and scalar operators to code.

\item incorporate the lower level optimizsed asqtad
      inverter that MILC use so we can run 20**3.64
      lattices on a rack of QCDOC

DONE:

\item (*) Add force monitoring for HMC. Currently, we have energy
contributions for each monomial. More useful is contributions to force
for each monomial. This monitor is simply  norm2(ds_u)

\item Change check_PROGRAMS to bin_PROGRAMS and install binaries
in chroma/mainprogs/main

\item Simple aniso for DWF - fix weirdness

\item 4D Chrono Predictor Done. (23/Feb/2005) - 5D Chrono Predictor Done (24/Feb 2004) 

\item BAGEL Running on Bluegene/L using QCDOC target and QMP_v2. IBM needs checking/porting still (potential XLC/isms). Detailed report to write.
