To run these tests.

Compile either t_ritz  -- naive ritz
               t_ritz_KS -- Kalkreuter Simma Ritz
	       t_ritz5d_KS -- 5D Kalkreuter Simma Ritz

(you can find them in chroma/mainprogs/tests)

then move the relevant t_ritz.xml.in file to a file called DATA
(ie t_ritz.xml.in if you want to run t_ritz, t_ritz_KS.xml.in if
you want to run t_ritz_KS)

then run the program.

It produces a file called t_ritz.xml
You can compare this with the relevant t_ritz.xml.out file
