        the tree. All fermacts now have some default derivative
        support (possibly nothing more than Not Implemented message).
        Qprop and QpropT now produced via factory functions ala
        LinearOperators. Now have a SystemSolver class - can be used

	Version 1.12.0. Now have a FermBC factory/foundries. Removed 
        explicit FermBC args from FermAct factories and now the creation
        of the FermBC is done within the construction of the FermAct.
        Similarly, HMC will create FermActs as needed. The old "boundary"
        within propagator.cc input is now shoved into the FermionAction
        xml.

12/23/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.11.3. More HMC changes.

12/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

        structure. Removed dsdu stuff - now in linops. Introduced
        levels of fermacts (base or not) that have derivs. All low
        level fermacts/linops have an additional template param for
        type of conjugate momenta in derivative. Made all fermacts and
        linops within chroma namespace.

12/09/2004 -- Robert Edwards

11/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.9.0. Big merge of Wilson and Staggered builds - now all
        the same. Cleaned up automake files so make distcheck  should work.

11/20/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.8.2. More changes within Zolo Ferm support. 
        Changed staggered files to use LatticeStaggeredFermion

        initialization. New support for variable initialization.

09/28/2004 -- Balint

     -- ZolotarevStateInfo has been renamed to OverlapStateInfo
	( and the previous empty OverlapStateInfo base class has been removed)

     -- I have added the state_info field to Propagator_Input_t 
	  as a standard string. I had it in ChromaProp_t first but I 
	  believe it should not be part of the <Param> </Param>
	  tagset but rather live at the same level as Cfg_t in the
	  top level applications. Look in propagator.cc to see how 
	  I manage it. Essentially I do this (propagator.cc line 84):

    // Read any auxiliary state information
    // if it exists
    if( inputtop.count("StateInfo") == 1 ) {
      XMLReader xml_state_info(inputtop, "StateInfo");
      std::ostringstream os;
      xml_state_info.print(os);
      input.stateInfo = os.str();
    }
    else {
    // Write an empty <?xml ... ><StateInfo/> document if not 
    // found 
      XMLBufferWriter s_i_xml;
      push(s_i_xml, "StateInfo");
      pop(s_i_xml);
      input.stateInfo = s_i_xml.str();
    }

    I have added dummy createState() functions to the various
    fermacts that read from an XML containing StateInfo. Apart
    from the overlap, these createState()-s just ignore
    the XML, but this virtual func could be a good hook for you
    if you add StateInfo to some ZolotarevCoeff-ed DWF fermacts.
    In fact, if you just write these, they'll be picked up appropriately
    by propagator...

    A sample usage of state info is in 
	chroma/tests/propagator/propagator_zolo4d_v6.xml.in

    -- As agreed, I have removed backward compatibility with 
    SZIN - type vectors in createOverlapState() -- now just 
    uses my evecs.

    -- I have written factory functions for creating OverlapConnectState-s
    in overlap_state.h overlap_state.cc. I originally wrote these
    as templated funcs, but then I couldn't shove them into the .cc file
    - they'd needed to have stayed in the .h file where the prototypes
    are defined. So I did similar things to the Inverter functions. 
    I wrote out the "specialisations" in the .h file and wrapped a templated
    version in the .cc. Your fermact's createState()-s can just dive on these
    see ovlap_partfrac_4d_fermact_w.[h,cc]. The issue of 4D and 5D BC's is
    hacked around as discussed:

  	i) The aux ferm act gets trivial BC-s. This doesn't matter as 
	   we never use them. We always use the BC-s of the parent.
       ii) the createOverlapState() function is passed a linOp which
	   the caller FermAct constructs. AuxMass is therefore no longer
	   passed
       iii) the createOverlapState() function creates a SimpleConnectState
           internally to call the passed linOp with, after applying
	   the modifyU() function of the passed FermBC

    -- Zolotarev4DFermAct and Zolotarev5DFermActArray have been renamed:
     as  OverlapPartFrac4DFermAct
     and 
	 UnprecOverlapContFrac5DFermActArray

     and put in ovlap_partfrac4d_fermact_w.[h,cc] 
         and    unprec_ovlap_contfrac4d_fermact_array_w.[h,cc] 

    the zolotarev5d_linop_array_w.[h,cc] is still there but will
    also be renamed real soon now.  

    -- I have removed the double mappings for backward compatibility
    ZOLOTAREV_4D and ZOLOTAREV_5D are dead. Now you need to specify
    something like:

  <FermionAction>
    <FermAct>OVERLAP_PARTIAL_FRACTION_4D</FermAct>
    <IsChiral>true</IsChiral>
    <ApproximationType>ZOLOTAREV</ApproximationType>
    <Mass>0.04</Mass>
    <RatPolyDeg>17</RatPolyDeg>
    <InnerSolve>
      <MaxCG>1000</MaxCG>
      <RsdCG>1.0e-7</RsdCG>
      <ReorthFreq>20</ReorthFreq>
    </InnerSolve>
    <AuxFermAct>
      <FermAct>UNPRECONDITIONED_WILSON</FermAct>
      <Mass>-1.4</Mass>
    </AuxFermAct>
  </FermionAction>

   Other new FermActs:

 	"UNPRECONDITIONED_OVERLAP_CONTINUED_FRACTION_5D"
and soon "OVERLAP_CONTINUED_FRACTION_5D" (which will be preconditioned)

    
    ApproximationType can be "ZOLOTAREV" or "TANH" for now.
    Robert feel free to add your own here if you want. 

	io/enum_io/enum_coeffs_io.[h,cc]
	io/enum_io/enum_fermacttype_io.[h,cc]

    I have removed therefore the old XML input files from the repository
    and added in the new ones.

    -- Approximation type can now also be TANH with the following caveats:

	i) rescaling: I am still not clear on this. I may not need
	to do this at all or I may need to do it the same way 
	as done in the ZOLO case. I'll ask Tony.
	
	ii) projection: I saw in your paper that in the Borici 
	(TANH) case, the EigValFunc is not signum but in fact 
	the polar approximation: \epsilon_{Ls/2}


    -- Also note from the above XML, that as agreed, I pushed the IsChiral
    to be a user supplied parameter. So that if we have a bad approximation
    for Zolotarev we can set it to false. Likewise if we have a supremely
    high order tanh approximation with projection so that we are effectively
    chiral then you can set it to true.

    -- fermact_paramio.h fermact_paramio.cc zolotarev4d_fermact_paramio.h
       zolotarev4d_fermact_paramio.cc are GONE (removed from CVS)
       zolotarev5d_fermact_paramio.[h,cc] are still around but 
       will be gone real soon now.

        BiCG codes, SUMR, CG, etc. and multi-mass variants. Fixed KYU qprop
        reader.

05/13/2004 -- Robert Edwards

02/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.5.0. Major change in propagator model in main programs. ONLY
        support SciDAC format of propagators. Now, the "Param" group on input is the
        header of some propagator. There are XML and binary parts of propagators
        (SciDAC format). The XML part is used in subsequent calculations, thus removing
        potentially erroneous use of input params in calcs.
        All test files changed to match

02/22/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.4. Some new programs added. Fixed make_source/propagator/seqprop/spectrum

	Also, added WILSON and STAGGERED build control.

01/01/2004 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.0. Removed all proxies. Switched to only use Handles
	(proxies were just glorified handles). Changed fermact factory
	functions to require a Handle<const ConnectState>  instead of a
	pointer to a connect state.  Added Fermion and Gauge BC support.
	Now a new virtual getFermBC in FermAct.  Now, the semantics is
	the FermAct is responsible for applying the Fermionic BC. All
	the fermacts changed to pass a FermBC which is then applied
	to the U fields in createState. This is supplied as a default
	in createState. 
        First tentative code for pure gauge heatbath and dyn. ferm. HMC.

12/31/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.2. More tweaks in fermacts. Added first versions
        of heatbath and HMC (not working yet).
        This is a pre-release before major changes to come. The next
        version changes substantially the fermacts - now gauge and
        fermion BC are included in the proper way.

12/06/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.1. Added various gauge fixing routines.

	Version 1.1.4. Switched LinearOperator and FermionAction interfaces to
        pass what was return type as instead argument to operator() & apply (linop)
        and dsdu (fermact).

11/20/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.3. Small tweaks.

11/16/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.2. Added extended-overlap action and linop.

11/14/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.1. Rearranged fermact files and made more base classes.
        Merged separate dsdu and qprop files into corresponding fermact files.

11/14/2003 -- Robert Edwards
