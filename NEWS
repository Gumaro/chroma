01/26/2004 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.4.2. More eigenvalue stuff. Tagging pre-release of the
        new SSE Wilson dslash support.

01/07/2004 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.4.1. Functioning Zolotarev code by Balint Joo.
	Also, added WILSON and STAGGERED build control.

01/01/2004 -- Robert Edwards
	Version 1.4.0. Removed all proxies. Switched to only use Handles
	(proxies were just glorified handles). Changed fermact factory
	functions to require a Handle<const ConnectState>  instead of a
	pointer to a connect state.  Added Fermion and Gauge BC support.
	Now a new virtual getFermBC in FermAct.  Now, the semantics is
	the FermAct is responsible for applying the Fermionic BC. All
	the fermacts changed to pass a FermBC which is then applied
	to the U fields in createState. This is supplied as a default
	in createState. 
        First tentative code for pure gauge heatbath and dyn. ferm. HMC.

12/31/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.2. More tweaks in fermacts. Added first versions
        of heatbath and HMC (not working yet).
        This is a pre-release before major changes to come. The next
        version changes substantially the fermacts - now gauge and
        fermion BC are included in the proper way.

12/06/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.1. Added various gauge fixing routines.

12/02/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.0. Another overhaul of FermionAction support. Now
        create and pass around gauge connection state.

12/01/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.1. Minor tweaks. Pre-release for 1.3.0 .

11/23/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.0. Overhauled FermionAction and LinearOperator. Added
        new even-odd preconditioned support.

11/20/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.4. Switched LinearOperator and FermionAction interfaces to
        pass what was return type as instead argument to operator() & apply (linop)
        and dsdu (fermact).

11/20/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.3. Small tweaks.

11/16/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.2. Added extended-overlap action and linop.

11/14/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.1. Rearranged fermact files and made more base classes.
        Merged separate dsdu and qprop files into corresponding fermact files.

11/14/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.0. Added array versions of fermacts. Now have functioning
        unprecondition DWF operator.

10/09/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.0.1. Changed all cout/cerr/QDP_info to use QDPIO::cout/cerr.

10/07/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.0.0. First major release. Supports sse extensions. Several
        bits in production. More to come.
