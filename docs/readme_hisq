Dear Alan,
         We have to decide exactly what 
is required for the HISQ coding effort. This will be 
done after we have consulted MILC. I wrote,
but didn't fully debug a HISQ inverter
in chroma. The details are below. This may be 
useful to focus your chroma efforts, although
we were not planning to use chroma for the 
generation of configurations.

The wrapper to the HISQ inverter in chroma
is in:

chroma/mainprogs/tests/t_propagator_s.cc


  HisqFermActParams hisq_param;
  hisq_param.Mass = input.param.Mass;
  hisq_param.u0   = input.param.u0;
  HisqFermAct S_f(cfs, hisq_param);

I believe that the main code is in

chroma/lib/actions/ferm/fermacts
hisq_fermact_params_s.cc
hisq_fermact_params_s.h
hisq_fermact_s.cc
hisq_fermact_s.h
